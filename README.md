# iPiano
A system to encourage proper hand positioning in children learning to play the piano developed as part of ESC103-Praxis II
## Introduction
iPiano encourages piano students aged **4 to 7** at 88Keys, a piano studio, to improve their **hand posture** using **real-time visual feedback** via LEDs. A **pre-trained machine-learning algorithm** tracks the angles of the **wrist** and **fourth and fifth fingers**. When an angle is outside the preferred values, the respective LED will light up to provide feedback and **encourage** proper piano hand form.
