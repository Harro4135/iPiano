## Introduction
iPiano encourages piano students aged **4 to 7** at 88Keys, a piano studio, to improve their **hand posture** using **real-time visual feedback** via LEDs. A **pre-trained machine-learning algorithm** tracks the angles of the **wrist** and **fourth and fifth fingers**. When an angle is outside the preferred values, the respective LED will light up to provide feedback and **encourage** proper piano hand form.    
## Demo 
This is a video of the working prototype developed as a proof of concept and requirement testing device. It uses a wireless protocol to communicate the incorrect position to the hardware device seen.

## Teamwork
The development of this project was done on a very short timeline, our team worked tirelessly to fulfill all requirements presented in the course. Additionally, we were 1 of 10 teams out of 55 to be selected as finalists for the Rowe Award: This then involved an extra 15-minute presentation at our design showcase in front of outside judges. We were unfortunately not selected for this award, however, the preparation was invaluable and led to us achieving an outstanding grade on the project.
